This project was developed as part of the "Data Visualization" course at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (Master in Digital Innovation - EIT Digital). It presents an interactive Shiny web app for analyzing fight data from the Ultimate UFC Dataset.

Project Overview
The goal was to build an interactive tool that assists analysts in exploring UFC fight data through multiple visual idioms. Each idiom was designed to answer specific analytical questions using visualization techniques and interactions.

This was a group project consisting of four members. My contribution focused on Idiom 2: "Exploring Fight Outcome Distributions Across UFC Weight Classes".

Features
Idiom 1 ‚Äì Finish Trend Analysis Over Time (stacked area chart)
My Part: Idiom 2 ‚Äì Outcome Distributions by Weight Class (interactive radar chart)
Idiom 3 ‚Äì Heatmap of Fight Rounds vs Age & Country
Idiom 4 ‚Äì Geographic Distribution of UFC Fights (choropleth maps)
My Contribution ‚Äì Idiom 2: Exploring Fight Outcomes
I was responsible for designing and implementing Idiom 2, an interactive radar chart for exploring fight outcomes across UFC weight classes. This module allows analysts to:

Compare finish types (KO/TKO, Submission, Decisions, etc.) by weight class
Filter data by gender and whether the fight was a title bout
Dynamically select which finish types to include in the chart
Use hover tooltips, legend filtering, and zoomable axes
Features I Implemented
Radar Chart (Plotly) to visualize multi-variable distributions
Filter Controls:
Gender switch (Male/Female)
Title Bout toggle
Finish Type selector with "Select All / Deselect All"
Interactive Legend & Tooltips for exploratory analysis
Dynamic rendering to adjust based on selected filters
This idiom supports both discovery (e.g., identifying unexpected patterns in title fights) and comparison (e.g., contrasting male vs. female outcome trends) across weight classes.

For a full explanation of the design, data abstraction, task abstraction, and implementation, refer to the Idiom 2 section in report.pdf from page 9 to page 13.
